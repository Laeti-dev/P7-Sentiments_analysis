    "| USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) | Produces embeddings for entire sentences rather than individual words, leveraging deep learning models. | Captures sentence-level semantics; pre-trained models available for quick use.                | Higher computational cost; less effective for word-level tasks.             |\n",
